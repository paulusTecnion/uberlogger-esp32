        <summary>Setting analog inputs</summary>
        <p>
          The UberLogger can measure temperature, analog voltage, and digital
          signals. Ensure the correct configuration for accurate results:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <b>Enabling channels:</b> You can enable or disable or signal using
            the enable checkbox. Disabling channels leads to smaller log files.
            Ideal for long measurements.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Custom labels:</b> You can give each label a custom name. The
            maximum length is 16 characters and cannot contain any space or
            special characters, except hyphens '-' and underscores '_'.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>NTCx/AINx selection:</b> Choose between temperature or voltage
            for each channel using both the hardware DIP-switch <b>and</b> the
            configuration page.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>AINx range selection:</b> Adjust the input voltage range (-10V
            ... +10V or -60V ... +60V) for better resolution and reduced noise.
            This should also be set using the DIP-switch and the configuration
            page.

    <!-- Sampling Settings -->
    <div class="flexdiv-md greybox">
      <h3>Sampling settings</h3>
      <details>
        <summary>Choosing the right sample rate</summary>
        <p>
          The UberLogger allows configurable sampling rates and resolutions to
          capture data accurately. The sample rate affects:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <b>Maximum frequency:</b> The higher the sample rate, the higher the
            frequency the logger can capture.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Storage space:</b> Higher sample rates require more space on the
            SD card.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Frequency requirements: </b> The appropriate sampling frequency
            for your measurements depends on the signal you wish to capture
            accurately. It is recommended to set the sample rate at least twice
            the maximum frequency of the signal of interest. For instance, if
            your signal's highest frequency is 50 Hz, logging at 100 Hz will
            prevent aliasing (signal distortion due to a too low sample rate).
            For temperature logging, most applications can achieve satisfactory
            results with sampling frequencies as low as 1 Hz or 5 Hz. This
            ensures sufficient data points for precise temperature measurements
            without significantly increasing data storage requirements.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          The resolution can be set to 12-bit or 16-bit. Higher resolutions
          improve accuracy but may impact performance at high sample rates.

    <!-- Averaging -->
    <div class="flexdiv-md greybox">
      <h3>Averaging</h3>
      <details>
        <summary>How averaging works</summary>
        <p>
          For sample frequencies below 1 Hz, you can choose to average the
          samples over the desired sample frequency or only take one sample at
          the desired sample rate. For example, if you enable this option with a
          sample frequency of 1 Sample/minute, the average will be taken over 1
          minute of samples using an IIR filter. After 1 minute, the average
          will be output to the file.
        </p>
        <p>
          <i>
            <b>Note:</b> Averaging is performed using a 25 Hz sample rate and an
            IIR low-pass filter with a -3 dB cut-off frequency at the desired
            output sample rate.</i

        <summary>
          Setting continuous measurement or external trigger/control
        </summary>
        <p>The UberLogger supports three measurement modes:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <b>Continuous measurement:</b> Start and stop logging via the web
            interface or the physical button.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>External trigger:</b> The logger waits for an external trigger
            signal to start logging.
            <i
              ><b>Note: </b> Live view is not working when no trigger has
              trigged a measurement.</i
            >
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>External control:</b> Start/stop logging is fully controlled via
            a digital input.
            <i
              ><b>Note:</b> The physical start / stop button and the web
              interface start / stop buttons are <b>not</b> working in external
              controller mode.</i
            >
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          For external trigger and external control, you can also set the
          <b>trigger debounce time</b> to stabilize the trigger input, reducing
          noise in trigger signals. By default this is set to 100 ms. But you
          can also increase it up to 60000 ms to create a delayed measurement.
          The debouncing timer will reset upon getting to low level within the
          debounce time, restarting the debounce timer.

      <details>
        <summary>Synchronize the Uberlogger time with your local time</summary>
        <p>
          The UberLogger features an internal real-time clock (RTC) that tracks
          time, even during power off (if the battery is installed, which it is
          by default). You can synchronize the RTC with your local time via the
          "Configuration" page. This ensures accurate timestamps for recorded
          data.

        </p>
        <p>
          <b>File Format:</b>
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <b>CSV:</b> CSV format writes data directly to CSV files, ideal for
            low sample rates or short measurement durations. CSV files are
            easily readable in tools like Excel.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Raw Data:</b> Raw format records raw data for long measurements,
            which can be later converted into CSV files using the provided
            Python or Windows conversion tools. Raw data is more storage
            efficient for long recordings.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          <b>File Name Mode:</b>
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <b>Sequential:</b> Generates filenames in a sequential order (e.g.,
            `log0`, `log1`, etc.), overwriting existing files with the same
            name.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Timestamp:</b> Generates filenames with a timestamp in the format
            `YYYYMMDD_Time_FilePrefix.csv`. This avoids overwriting and helps
            track when files were created.
          </li>

          <li>
            <b>File split size:</b> automatically split files into smaller

          You can initiate calibration by pressing the "Start Calibration"
